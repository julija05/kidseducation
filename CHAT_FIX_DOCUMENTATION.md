# Chat System Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Session Persistence Problem
**Problem**: Chat conversation was resetting when users navigated between pages because the chat state was stored only in React component state.

**Solution**: 
- Created a global `ChatContext` using React Context API
- Implemented session storage to persist chat data across page navigation
- Chat conversation, messages, unread count, and sound preferences are now stored in `sessionStorage`

### 2. Real-time Message Delivery
**Problem**: Admin messages weren't being delivered to guest users browsing other pages because polling only happened when the chat component was mounted.

**Solution**:
- Implemented global polling in the `ChatContext` that runs regardless of chat widget state
- Messages are fetched every 3 seconds when a conversation exists
- Toast notifications appear on all pages when new admin messages arrive
- Sound notifications play (limited to 2 per session) when chat is closed

### 3. Notification Sound Fix
**Problem**: Notification sounds were playing endlessly when the chat was open, and notifications were being triggered when closing the chat instead of only on new messages.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the chat open state management to properly track when chat is active
- Restructured notification logic to ONLY trigger on truly new admin messages when chat is closed
- Fixed the condition to prevent notifications when simply changing chat state (open/close)
- Separated sound ID tracking from notification logic to prevent race conditions
- Added proper state synchronization between the ChatWidget and ChatContext

### 4. Conversation Reset for Closed Chats
**Problem**: When admin closes a conversation, guest users could still continue messaging in the closed conversation, making it impossible for admins to respond.

**Solution**:
- Modified backend to exclude closed conversations when finding existing guest conversations
- Added frontend detection for when a conversation becomes closed
- Automatically reset chat data for guest users when conversation is closed by admin
- Guest users must re-enter name and email to start a fresh conversation after admin closes the previous one

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created

1. **`/resources/js/Contexts/ChatContext.jsx`**
   - Global state management for chat functionality
   - Session storage integration for persistence
   - Background polling for real-time updates
   - Sound and notification management

2. **`/resources/js/Components/Chat/GlobalChatToast.jsx`**
   - Global toast notifications that appear on any page
   - "Open Chat" button to activate chat from notification
   - Auto-hide after 5 seconds

### Modified Files

1. **`/resources/js/Components/Chat/ChatWidget.jsx`**
   - Refactored to use ChatContext instead of local state
   - Removed duplicate polling and notification logic
   - Added event listener for global chat opening
   - Integrated with global state management

2. **`/resources/js/Layouts/GuessFrontLayout.jsx`**
   - Wrapped with ChatProvider for global state
   - Added GlobalChatToast component

## Key Features

### Session Persistence
- Chat conversations persist across page navigation
- Visitor information (name/email) is maintained
- Message history is preserved
- Unread count remains accurate

### Real-time Notifications
- Toast notifications appear on all pages for new admin messages
- Sound notifications (limited to 2 per session)
- Visual indicators on chat button (unread count, pulsing animation)
- Automatic notification clearing when chat is opened

### Cross-Page Functionality
- Chat state is shared across all pages
- Notifications work on home, contact, about, and all other pages
- Clicking "Open Chat" on toast notification activates the chat widget
- Background polling continues even when chat is closed

### Smart Notification Logic
- Sounds only play when chat is closed (no endless notification sounds)
- Toast notifications automatically hide when chat is opened
- Unread count clears immediately when chat becomes active
- Proper state synchronization prevents notification race conditions

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
// Global chat state persisted in sessionStorage
- conversation (chat session data)
- messages (chat history)
- unreadCount (unread admin messages)
- playedSoundIds (prevent duplicate sounds)
- soundCount (limit notifications)
```

### Background Polling
```javascript
// Polls every 3 seconds when conversation exists
useEffect(() => {
    if (conversation?.conversation_id && isInitialized) {
        startPolling();
    }
}, [conversation, isInitialized]);
```

### Notification Logic
```javascript
// Check for truly new admin messages (not existing ones)
const adminMessages = newMessages.filter(msg => 
    msg.sender_type === 'admin' && 
    !messages.find(existing => existing.id === msg.id)
);

// ONLY trigger notifications for NEW messages when chat is CLOSED
if (adminMessages.length > 0 && !isChatOpen) {
    setHasNewAdminMessage(true);
    setToastMessage(`New message from support: ${adminMessages[adminMessages.length - 1].message}`);
    setShowToast(true);
    
    // Play sound for new messages
    const newSoundMessages = adminMessages.filter(msg => !playedSoundIds.has(msg.id));
    if (newSoundMessages.length > 0 && soundCount < 2) {
        playSimpleNotificationSound();
    }
}

// Always track ALL admin messages to prevent future duplicates
const allAdminMessages = newMessages.filter(msg => msg.sender_type === 'admin');
const unprocessedAdminMessages = allAdminMessages.filter(msg => !playedSoundIds.has(msg.id));
if (unprocessedAdminMessages.length > 0) {
    setPlayedSoundIds(prev => {
        const newSet = new Set(prev);
        unprocessedAdminMessages.forEach(msg => newSet.add(msg.id));
        return newSet;
    });
}
```

### State Synchronization
```javascript
// Sync chat open state with context
useEffect(() => {
    setChatOpen(isOpen);
}, [isOpen, setChatOpen]);
```

## Testing Scenarios

To test the fixes:

1. **Session Persistence Test**:
   - Start a chat conversation on home page
   - Navigate to contact or about page
   - Verify chat history and state are maintained
   - Continue conversation from new page

2. **Real-time Delivery Test**:
   - Start chat as guest user
   - Navigate to another page (e.g., contact)
   - Have admin respond from admin panel
   - Verify toast notification appears on current page
   - Click "Open Chat" to continue conversation

3. **Cross-Page Functionality Test**:
   - Start chat on any page
   - Navigate through multiple pages
   - Verify unread count and notifications persist
   - Test opening chat from different pages

4. **Conversation Reset Test**:
   - Start chat as guest user
   - Have conversation with admin
   - Admin closes the conversation from admin panel
   - Verify guest user's chat resets and shows visitor form
   - Guest must re-enter name/email to start new conversation

## Browser Support

- Session storage is supported in all modern browsers
- Graceful fallback if session storage is unavailable
- Audio notifications work in browsers that support Web Audio API

## Performance Considerations

- Polling is limited to active conversations only
- Session storage cleanup on conversation end
- Sound notifications limited to 2 per session to avoid annoyance
- Efficient state updates to minimize re-renders

## Security Notes

- All chat data is validated server-side
- Session-based authentication for guest users
- No sensitive data stored in session storage
- CSRF protection maintained for all requests

## Conversation Reset Logic

### Backend Changes
```php
// Modified ChatController initChat() method
// For guests, exclude closed conversations
$conversation = ChatConversation::where('session_id', $sessionId)
    ->whereIn('status', ['active', 'waiting', 'draft'])
    ->first();
```

### Frontend Changes
```javascript
// ChatContext fetchMessages() method
// Detect closed conversations and reset for guest users
if (updatedConversation.status === 'closed' && !window.Laravel?.user) {
    clearChatData();
    return; // Exit early, conversation is reset
}
```

### User Experience
- When admin closes conversation, guest user's chat immediately resets
- All chat history and state is cleared from session storage
- Visitor form reappears requiring name and email entry
- Fresh conversation is created when guest sends first message
- Clean separation between support sessions for better admin workflow
